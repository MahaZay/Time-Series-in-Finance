### Step 1: Addressing Non-Normal Residuals with Transformation

# Assuming apple_stock_data$Close is your closing price column
apple_stock_data$LogClose <- log(apple_stock_data$Close)  # Log transformation

# Fit ARIMA model on the transformed data
log_arima_model <- auto.arima(apple_stock_data$LogClose)


### Step 2: Define a Wider Event Window

# Define a window around the announcement dates
window_size <- 30  # For example, 30 days before and after

# Create a wider event window around announcement dates
apple_stock_data$WiderEventWindow <- 0
for (date in iphone_release_dates$Announced) {
  apple_stock_data$WiderEventWindow <- ifelse(abs(as.numeric(apple_stock_data$Date - date)) <= window_size, 1, apple_stock_data$WiderEventWindow)
}

### Step 3: Fit ARIMA Model with the Wider Event Window

# Fit ARIMA model with the wider event window, use auto arima!
event_arima_model <- auto.arima(apple_stock_data$LogClose, xreg = apple_stock_data$WiderEventWindow)

### Step 4: Analyze the Impact of iPhone Announcements
# View the coefficients of the ARIMA model
coefficients(event_arima_model)


# Hypothesis test for the impact of iPhone announcements
summary(event_arima_model)



# Load the lmtest package if not already loaded
library(lmtest)

# Fit the ARIMA model with the wider event window (event_arima_model)
# Replace 'your_formula' with the actual formula used to fit the ARIMA model
# For example: your_formula <- Close ~ WiderEventWindow
your_formula <- Close ~ WiderEventWindow
arima_with_event <- lm(your_formula, data = apple_stock_data)

# Perform the hypothesis test for the coefficient of WiderEventWindow
# Replace 'your_coefficient_name' with the actual coefficient name (e.g., xregWiderEventWindow)
# For example: your_coefficient_name <- "WiderEventWindow"
your_coefficient_name <- "WiderEventWindow"
hypothesis_test <- coeftest(arima_with_event, hypothesis = your_coefficient_name)

# Print the hypothesis test results
print(hypothesis_test)

#The output of the hypothesis test for the coefficient of WiderEventWindow in the linear regression model
#provides the following results:

#Estimate: This is the estimated coefficient value for WiderEventWindow.
#In your case, it is approximately 12.85001.

#Std. Error: This is the standard error associated with the estimated coefficient. 
#It measures the variability of the coefficient estimate. In your case, it is approximately 2.06667.

#t value: This is the t-statistic, which measures how many standard errors the estimated 
#coefficient is away from zero. In your case, it is approximately 6.2177.

#Pr(>|t|): This is the p-value associated with the t-statistic. It indicates the probability of observing
#a t-statistic as extreme as the one calculated, assuming that the
#true coefficient value is zero (i.e., no effect).

#Now, let's interpret the results:

#Intercept (Intercept):

#Estimate: The estimated intercept value is approximately 47.21130.
#Std. Error: The standard error for the intercept is approximately 0.91848.
#t value: The t-statistic for the intercept is very large (approximately 51.4017).
#Pr(>|t|): The p-value associated with the intercept is extremely small (< 2.2e-16), 
#indicating that the intercept is highly statistically significant.
#This means that there is strong evidence that the intercept is not equal to zero.
#WiderEventWindow (Coefficient of Interest):

#Estimate: The estimated coefficient for WiderEventWindow is approximately 12.85001.
#Std. Error: The standard error for this coefficient is approximately 2.06667.
#t value: The t-statistic for this coefficient is approximately 6.2177.
#Pr(>|t|): The p-value associated with this coefficient is also very small (5.527e-10), indicating that the coefficient is highly statistically significant. This suggests that there is strong evidence of a statistically significant effect of iPhone announcements (WiderEventWindow) on the stock price.
#In summary, based on the results of the hypothesis test, 
#both the intercept and the coefficient of WiderEventWindow are highly statistically significant. 
#This means that there is strong evidence to suggest that 
# iPhone announcements have a statistically significant effect on the Apple stock price, 
# as the coefficient of WiderEventWindow is significantly different from zero.




# Coefficient of interest
coefficient_name <- "WiderEventWindow"

# Get the coefficient estimate
coefficient_estimate <- coef(arima_with_event)[coefficient_name]

# Check the sign of the coefficient

#EXPLANATION OF SUMMARY:
#GARCH(1,1) model indicates that both the autoregressive term 
#and the moving average term 
#are significant, meaning past data and past volatility are predictive of current volatility.
#The constant term 
#is also significant, representing the long-run average variance.
#The high significance of these terms suggests a good fit for
#the volatility pattern in Apple's stock price changes. 
#The Jarque-Bera test's rejection of normality is typical in financial returns 
#due to heavy tails. This doesn't negate the model but implies caution 
#in assuming normal distribution for risk metrics. The Box-Ljung test shows
#no autocorrelation in the residuals, meaning the model
